# Code/Architecture Kata: Bot Wars - Factory of Heroes

In this Code/Architecture Kata you will be implementing a strategy/roleplaying game using loosely based on the popular mobile game [Star Warsâ„¢ Galaxy of Heroes](http://starwars.ea.com/en_GB/starwars/galaxy-of-heroes). This Kata is supposed to be more complex than most of the well-known traditional Katas (e.g. Roman Numbers, Bowling Game or FizzBuzz) including even the [EverCraft Kata](https://github.com/PuttingTheDnDInTDD/EverCraft-Kata) or my own [Kata TCG](https://github.com/bkimminich/kata-tcg). It offers many possibilities for different focuses depending on learning goals and can be approached iteratively with TDD from different angles. The Kata is especially well suited for building extensible software because the gameplay could be extended or modified in many ways. While it is not recommended to use this Kata for TDD introduction-trainings, it should offer challenges for developers of higher experience levels.
