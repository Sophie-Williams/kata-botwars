# Kata: Bot Wars - Factory of Heroes

In this Code/Architecture Kata you will be implementing a strategy/role-playing game using loosely based on the popular mobile game [Star Warsâ„¢ Galaxy of Heroes](http://starwars.ea.com/en_GB/starwars/galaxy-of-heroes). This Kata is supposed to be more complex than most of the well-known traditional Katas (e.g. Roman Numbers, Bowling Game or FizzBuzz) including even the [EverCraft Kata](https://github.com/PuttingTheDnDInTDD/EverCraft-Kata) or my own [Kata TCG](https://github.com/bkimminich/kata-tcg). It offers many possibilities for different focuses depending on learning goals and can be approached iteratively with TDD from different angles. The Kata is especially well suited for building extensible software because the gameplay could be extended or modified in many ways. While it is not recommended to use this Kata for TDD introduction-trainings, it should offer challenges for developers of higher experience levels.

## Product Vision

_Bot Wars_ is supposed to be an addictive strategy game where two players battle each other with a team of robots. Players start with a pool of pre-defined
robot types. There are bots which excel as damage-dealers, tanks, supports or healers as well as some more "jack-of-all-trades"-style bots. When a game
begins, both players assemble a team of robots from their roster and send them to the battlefield. The bots now take turns in attacking the enemy team or
performing other actions, e.g. healing the own team. When one player's bot team is totally destroyed, the game ends.

Both the winner and the loser of the game get rewarded with experience, in-game currency and have a chance to receive upgrade-parts for their bots.
Given they have collected enough resources, players can train and upgrade their bots to become more powerful and efficient in battle. Players are
supposed to be able to play the game occasionally and still have their current roster of bots available.

For training purposes the game offers AI opponents to battle against. This allows players to validate their team composition and try out different strategies.

## Sprint 0: Design Session

### High-level solution design

> Create a high-level solution design or architecture sketch for the game, based only on what you learned from the Product Vision!

## Sprint 1: Basic Combat

### Feature 1: Damage Calculation

> As a powerful bot I want to deal heavy damage to my opponents so that I can blast through my opponent's armor!

* Bots have a _Power_ stat which determines their damage potential in combat.
* Bots also have an _Armor_ stat which reduces the damage they receive in combat.

The damage calculation works like this (in pseudo-code):

```
damage to opponent = (random(1/2*power of attacker - 1*power of attacker) - armor of opponent)
```

### Feature 2: Destroying Opponents

> As a resilient bot I want to be able to take several hits before being destroyed to that I am more useful to my player in matches!

* Bots have an _Integrity_ stat which is reduced by the damage received in combat.
* A bot with zero or less _Integrity_ is considered destroyed.

### Feature 3: Attack Sequence

> As a nimble bot I want to be able to outspeed my opponent so that I attack earlier and more often than he can.

* Bots have _Speed_ stat which influences how early and often they can attack
* Bots that participate in a battle use a _Turn Meter_ to determine the attack order among themselves
* Bots have an ```Evasion%```-chance based on the _Evasion_ stat of the bot to completely prevent an incoming attack.

The attack sequence should be determined and executed like this (in pseudo-code):

```
pre: for all bots(turn meter = 0)
loop:
  for all bots(
    turn meter += speed of bot
    if (turn meter >= 1000) {
      turn meter -= 1000
      attack opponent bot
    }
  )
:loop
```

### Feature 4: Team Battles

> As a competitive player I want to have a team of bots fight an opponent's team so that the game becomes more interesting!

* The game is intended for 2 players
* Each player sends a team of 3 bots into the arena
* When it is a bot's turn the player chooses one opponent bot to attack
* The game ends when one player's team has been eliminated

The battle loop looks like this (in pseudo-code):

```
pre: both players send 3 bots into arena
loop:
    determine potential attackers
    randomize order(attackers)
    for all attackers(
      choose opponent bot to attack
      attack opponent bot
      if (opponent bot(integrity <= 0)) {immediately remove opponent bot from battle}
    )
  }
:loop until(all remaining bots belong to one player)
post: declare player with remaining bots as winner
```

### Feature 5: Bot Types

> As a strategy game player I want to have different kinds of bots at my disposal to assemble my team from so that I can best counter my opponent's team composition.

* Bots need a _Name_ attribute that describes the type of bot they are.
* Both players have their own pool of Bots available to assemble their team from before each battle.
* A player cannot put a bot more than once into his/her team.

Name | Integrity | Power | Speed | Armor | Evasion
---- | --------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | -------
Aggro Bot | 800 | 100 | 40 | 20 | 0%
Stealth Bot | 500 | 70 | 90 | 20 | 20%
Glass Bot | 300 | 180 | 20 | 0 | 30%
Tank Bot | 1200 | 50 | 30 | 40 | 5%
Beaverette Bot | 1000 | 70 | 35 | 30 | 5%
Kamikaze Bot | 500 | 50 | 40 | 0 | 0%

## Sprint 2: Status Effects

### Feature 6: Negative Status Effects

> As a malevolent fighter I want my attacks to put negative effects over time on my victims so that they get less useful in battle

* Some bot's attacks have a chance to inflict a _Negative Status Effect_ on the target that lasts for a certain number of turns.
* A negative effect expires when its _Duration_ counter reaches zero.
* The _Duration_ counter is set in the turn where the effect was inflicted and decreases by one with every turn the affected bot takes.
* Negative Status Effects have a ```Resistance%```-chance to be prevented based on the _Resistance_ stat of the target bot.

Negative Effect | Description
--------------- | -----------
Defense Down | Reduces the _Armor_ and _Resistance_ of a bot by 50%. Can not be inflicted on bots who are already under this effect.
Offense Down | Reduces all caused _Damage_ of a bot by 50%. Can not be inflicted on bots who are already under this effect.
Continuous Damage | Damage over Time (DoT) effect that reduces a bot's integrity by '''power of attacker - armor of affected bot''' each turn until it expires. Can be stacked multiple times on the same bot.
Bomb | Performs a delayed _Standard Attack_ on the affected bot when its duration expires. Can be stacked multiple times on the same bot.
Speed Down | Slows the Turn Meter down by 25% which reduces the amount of actions a bot can take during battle.
Stun | Stunned bots will miss their next turn.

* The attacking bot first needs to beat his own _Effect Chance_ and then beat the _Resistance_ of its target to actually inflict an effect.
* If more than one effect is listed for a bot one of the effects is randomly inflicted. The only exception here is Kamikaze Bot who can potentially inflict three negative effects with just one attack.
* Remember that only some negative effects can be stacked multiple times on the same bot.

Bot | Effect Chance | Negative Effect(s) | Duration
--- | ------------- | ------------------ | --------
Aggro Bot | 30% | Defense Down _or_ Stun | 1
Stealth Bot | 40% | Speed Down _or_ Defense Down _or_ Offense Down | 2
Glass Bot | 65% | Continuous Damage | 2
Tank Bot | 25% | Bomb | 3
Beaverette Bot | n/a | n/a
Kamikaze Bot | 65% / 50% / 35 | Bomb / Defense Down / Speed Down | 1 / 2 / 1

### Feature 7: Positive Status Effects

#### NFR 2: Transportable Game-State

> As an addicted player I want to carry my game data with me so that I can play games with other players whenever I meet them.
